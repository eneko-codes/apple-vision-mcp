# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working in this repository.

## Data rule

Read-only server — there is nothing to modify or delete. Access is bounded by `read_roots`, configured per install.

## What this is

A local MCP server (Swift 6, stdio transport) for OCR: reading text out of an image or a scanned PDF through `Vision`'s `VNRecognizeTextRequest`. No Finder, no Apple events, no network, no write of any kind.

## Commands

```bash
swift build
swift build -c release
swift test
```

```bash
otool -P .build/release/apple-vision-mcp | grep UsageDescription
```
